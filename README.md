### About Atsuko: Nexus

**Atsuko: Nexus** is a full rewrite of the original Atsuko Discord bot — redesigned for **resilience**, **extensibility**, and **future-proofing**. Built with Python and powered by a new task-queue & P2P-inspired backend, the Nexus version focuses on **modular architecture**, **distributed stability**, and **scalable features**.

- Dynamic cog loading for effortless feature expansion  
- Custom help interface  
- Cleaner command structure via modern slash commands  
- Resilient by design with built-in recovery logic

> Original commands and systems are being rebuilt. Slash commands are replacing traditional prefixed ones. Legacy behavior may not work as expected.

## Collaborate and Customize

Atsuko's new architecture welcomes collaboration! Feel free to fork, contribute, and suggest new systems as we redefine what this bot can do. Whether you want to build a cog, refine the backend, or submit issues, your help is appreciated.
